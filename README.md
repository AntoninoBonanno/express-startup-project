# Express Startup Project

Quick Start Project is a Node.js server based on the Express framework and MySQL database.  

In this project we define an elegant and intuitive project structure, able to separate the correct responsibilities between the files. 
Furthermore, the basic functionalities of an Express server are already implemented, so as to have a ready-to-use project, where the only concern is to implement the API.
